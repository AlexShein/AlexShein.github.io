                  <span class="years">2021 - 2023</span>
                  <p>
                    As a Data Engineer, I initially focused on developing
                    software solutions using technologies like Python, SQL
                    Alchemy, Alembic, and AWS. I specialized in backend
                    development, creating services with FastAPI, setting up
                    infrastructure-as-code using Terraform, and managing
                    PostgreSQL databases with Alembic and SQL Alchemy ORM.
                    <br /><br />
                    Transitioning to Geospatial Fullstack Software Engineering
                    in June 2022, I expanded my expertise at analytics
                    department, developing a flood analysis platform using
                    React, AntD, FastAPI, PostgreSQL + PostGIS, and AWS. My role
                    encompassed full-stack development, infrastructure
                    management with Terraform and Kubernetes, and implementing
                    Argo Workflows for data processing.
                    <br /><br />
                    Key achievements included replacing legacy database
                    migration tools, improving system architecture by
                    introducing Argo Workflows, enhancing code quality through
                    Ruff linters, and conducting knowledge-sharing sessions
                    across engineering teams. Throughout these roles, I
                    demonstrated versatility in technologies like Python,
                    Golang, Docker, and cloud infrastructure, while developing
                    deep domain knowledge in geospatial data processing and web
                    service development.

            <p>
              Like almost every person living in Finland, I tend to spend a lot
              of time outdoors. I love walking along trails in forests or
              mountains and thoroughly enjoy the meditative state of mind it
              brings.

              Ever since childhood, I've been fascinated by aircraft. And I must
              say that exiting one mid-flight gives you some of the most
              breathtaking experiences life has to offer, provided that you have
              a parachute behind your back of course.

              There are almost no real mountains in Finland, at least not in the
              south, but there is a lot of mountain bikes everywhere. I decided
              to give it a try and join the movement. It turned out well worth
              it! Riding trails in forests, going downhill following narrow
              rocky paths in national parks is a fascinating experience! The
              exhausting pedaling uphill is slightly less so. But the experience
              gets even better when one goes straight to a hot sauna after.

            <p>
              After all energy-demanding activities, the body usually screams
              for callories, here's when baking kicks in.<br />
              During my visit to Sweden in 2023, I got inspired by a bakery
              named Valhalla because of a) the name and b) a lovely rye-wheat
              sourgdough bread with spices they're making. After
              <s>an interrogation</s> a nice chat with a person working there I
              decided to give it a try an baking a loaf or two at home. Long
              story short, that's how the addiction story starts.
